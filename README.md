# Alphabetical Asdf

This file defines an ASDF system class ALPHABETICAL-ASDF:SYSTEM
that automatically loads source files and directories (modules)
in alphabetical order. Therefore it is not necessary to manually
specify system components in the asd file, as they are inferred
from the directory structure and file names.
